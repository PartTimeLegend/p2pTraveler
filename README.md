I couldn't sleep so I wrote some code. :p

------------------------------------------

This is a rather simply complex application written as a proof of concept as a simple [worm](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/virus-worm-diffs.html). I've only ever run on my own machine, and is designed for you to see how an application can be self replicating.

The design is that when the executable runs it will attempt to copy itself to directories used for file sharing with names that would encourage someone to open. These directories and names can be amended in the payload class.

There is a simple strings class that contains a method for reversing a string. Strangely C# contains no native functionality for this, unlike VB.NET which contains strReverse.

Yes, I like to reverse strings several times over. It just kind of makes sense to reverse a string, do something and then reverse it back. In fact I like doing things with strings in general.

Don't break the law. If you do it's not my fault. I'm no more responsible for your actions that a shop that sells matches is responsible for arson.
